step - 1 - Audio extraction 

- here if we choose ffmpeg , this will be a ameature technique to do , why because ffmpeg will be get the dailouges + background music / explosation / rain / crowd sounds , this will are MIXED.

- that why we used trendy way 

- STEM SEPERATION

Video.mp4
    ↓ [FFmpeg extraction]
Raw_Audio.wav
    ↓ [AI Source Separation]
    ├─ Vocals.wav        (dialogue only)
    ├─ Music.wav         (background score)
    ├─ SFX.wav           (sound effects)
    └─ Ambient.wav       (atmosphere)


- so we can professionate our logic with best 

Then you:

Keep Music + SFX + Ambient (untouched)
Replace Vocals with dubbed version
Remix everything together with proper balance


- My logic

Is video < 5 minutes AND low budget?
  ├─ YES → Use basic FFmpeg extraction
  └─ NO  → Use stem separation workflow
           ├─ Is dialogue-heavy (talk show, interview)?
           │   └─ Use UVR (optimized for speech)
           └─ Is cinematic (movie, TV show)?
               └─ Use Demucs (preserves music quality)


then it will possible way to do our freely move on it.

it works like this flow :- 

INPUT FILE
   ↓
[ DEMUX ]  → separates audio & video streams
   ↓
[ DECODE ] → converts compressed data into raw frames/audio
   ↓
[ FILTER ] → resize, cut, change FPS, etc
   ↓
[ ENCODE ] → compress again
   ↓
[ MUX ] → pack into output file
   ↓
OUTPUT FILE

we can cut , edit , to mp3 .png , all type of we can do at their mode.



and demucs work like this :- 

song.mp3
  ↓
FFmpeg → Decode audio
  ↓
Convert to spectrogram
  ↓
Deep Neural Network (trained on 1000s of songs)
  ↓
Predict 4 masks:
   vocals
   drums
   bass
   other
  ↓
Apply masks
  ↓
Convert back to wave
